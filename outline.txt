He rents a small house in West Egg, a wealthy area known for its newly rich residents, and soon becomes acquainted with his neighbor, Jay Gatsby, who lives in a grand mansion. Nick describes the luxurious lifestyle of the area, contrasting it with his modest background. During a visit to his cousin Daisy’s home in East Egg, a more established and aristocratic community, Nick encounters her husband, Tom Buchanan, a domineering and arrogant man.
